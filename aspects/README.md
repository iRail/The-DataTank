# Aspects

An aspect crosscuts the program's core concerns, therefore violating its separation of concerns that tries to encapsulate unrelated functions.

Examples of aspects:
logging,
caching,
errorhandling...

## Our solution

As a generic webservice which is used by a lot of entities, we have a lot of cross cutting concerns. These concerns are gathered in aspects over here.
