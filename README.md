# develop

This is the development branch, this branch will be merged with separate branches where big features will be implemented separatly. When a branch is adult enough to merge it with the development branch, it will be merged and deleted. For small fixes and very small features the development will be adjusted without branching first. This branch is the most up to date version of The DataTank.

Take a look at the issues-section for further discussion and features!

# usages of The DataTank

# FlatTurtle bvba#

FlatTurtle creates APIs for your office building. Your office needs to keep in touch with real-time data surrounding the building: menu's, opening hours, traffic information, weather forecast, car parkings, train delays, expected arrival hours of airplanes, and so on.


# The DataTank & FlatData #

In order to set up an API we're using the open-source platform The DataTank. The DataTank is free software (AGPL, © 2011,2012 iRail NPO, 2012 OKFN Belgium) to create an API for non-local/dynamic data in no time.

If you want to read more about The DataTank please visit http://thedatatank.org for developer documentation, and http://thedatatank.com for introductions.

FlatTurtle has forked The DataTank to create a platform which integrates seaminglessly with our other products, like http://github.com/FlatTurtle/InfoScreen. This fork of The DataTank is called FlatData.
