# Packages

This is the place where users can add their own packages and resources. Say for example you don't want to create a strategy,but a stand-alone resource with specific logic, such as a webscraper, you can do so by adding a folder which will be handled as the package, and in that folder you place a resource file containing your logic.

For examples take a look at our [examples](https://github.com/iRail/The-DataTank-examples/tree/master/custom/packages). It contains useful examples of custom resources. Note that every folder should contain a php file called resources.php which contains array which holds all of the resource names in that package folder. This is also to be found in the [examples](https://github.com/iRail/The-DataTank-examples/tree/master/custom/packages) link.
