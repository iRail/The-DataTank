   <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> minor versions are represented by the
   third group of version digits, e.g., 8.4.2 is the second minor
   release of 8.4.  Minor releases never change the internal storage
   format and are always compatible with earlier and later minor
   releases of the same major version number, e.g., 8.4.2 is compatible
   with 8.4, 8.4.1 and 8.4.6.  To update between compatible versions,
   you simply replace the executables while the server is down and
   restart the server.  The data directory remains unchanged &mdash;
   minor upgrades are that simple.

>   For <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>major</I
></SPAN
> releases of <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
>, the
   internal data storage format is subject to change, thus complicating
   upgrades.  The traditional method for moving data to a new major version
   is to dump and reload the database.  Other, less-well-tested possibilities
   are available, as discussed below.
  </P
><P
>   New major versions also typically introduce some user-visible
   incompatibilities, so application programming changes may be required.
   Cautious users will want to test their client applications on the new
   version before switching over fully; therefore, it's often a good idea to
   set up concurrent installations of old and new versions.  When
   testing a <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN

   following categories of possible changes:

>   To dump data from one major version of <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN

   reload it in another, you must use <SPAN

   level backup methods will not work. (There are checks in place that prevent
   you from using a data directory with an incompatible version of
   <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN

   trying to start the wrong server version on a data directory.)
  </P

   <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>pg_dumpall</SPAN

   <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"

   that might have been made in these programs.  Current releases of the
   dump programs can read data from any server version back to 7.0.
  </P
><P
>   The least downtime can be achieved by installing the new server in
   a different directory and running both the old and the new servers
   in parallel, on different ports. Then you can use something like:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>pg_dumpall -p 5432 | psql -d postgres -p 6543</PRE
><P>

   to transfer your data.  Or you can use an intermediate file if you wish.
   Then you can shut down the old server and start the new server using
   the port the old one was running on. You should make sure that the
   old database is not updated after you begin to run
   <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>pg_dumpall</SPAN
>, otherwise you will lose those updates. See
   <A
HREF="client-authentication.html"
>Chapter 19</A
> for information on how to prohibit
   access.
  </P
><P
>   If you cannot or do not want to run two servers in parallel, you can
   do the backup step before installing the new version, bring down
   the old server, move the old version out of the way, install the new
   version, start the new server, and restore the data. For example:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>pg_dumpall &gt; backup
pg_ctl stop
mv /usr/local/pgsql /usr/local/pgsql.old
# Rename any tablespace directories as well
cd ~/postgresql-9.0.4
gmake install
initdb -D /usr/local/pgsql/data
postgres -D /usr/local/pgsql/data
psql -f backup postgres</PRE
><P>

   See <A
HREF="runtime.html"
>Chapter 17</A
> about ways to start and stop the
   server and other details. The installation instructions will advise
   you of strategic places to perform these steps.

    it might no longer be perfectly usable. Some of the executable programs
    contain absolute paths to various installed programs and data files.
    This is usually not a big problem, but if you plan on using two
    installations in parallel for a while you should assign them
    different installation directories at build time.  (This problem
    is rectified in <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> version 8.0 and later, so long
    as you move all subdirectories containing installed files together;
    for example if <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr/local/postgres/bin/</TT
> goes to
    <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr/local/postgres.old/bin/</TT

    <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr/local/postgres/share/</TT
> must go to
    <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr/local/postgres.old/share/</TT
>.  In pre-8.0 releases
    moving an installation like this will not work.)

   allows an installation to be migrated in-place from one major

   concurrently.  Also, <SPAN

   <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Slony</SPAN

   <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
>.  The standby can be on the same computer or
   a different computer.  Once it has synced up with the master server
   (running the older version of <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
>), you can
   switch masters and make the standby the master and shut down the older
   database instance.  Such a switch-over results in only several seconds
   of downtime for an upgrade.
